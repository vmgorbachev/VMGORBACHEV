### Hello! 👋👋👋

I am a Postdoc in **[Prof. Thomas R. Ward’s group](https://ward.chemie.unibas.ch/en/group/)** at the **University of Basel**, developing **in-silico methodologies for accurate prediction and optimization of oriented local electric fields (OLEF) in metalloenzymes**. Previously, I earned a **[PhD in Physical Organic Chemistry](https://www.research-collection.ethz.ch/handle/20.500.11850/647402)** with **[Prof. P. Chen](https://chen.ethz.ch)** at **ETH Zürich**. 🎓

Before that, I developed Python tools to analyze and support pharmaceutical downstream processes at **Novartis**, and modeled complex reaction networks during my MSc in Chemical Engineering. 🧑‍🔬

I enjoy tackling complex challenges—especially reconciling theory with experiment—and focus on building models that capture underlying physics. Here, I’m starting to share Python tools and scripts from my ongoing research. Collaboration is welcome! 🤝
